<!---# The microdown comment bug-->
In this task, we demonstrate a failure in the development environment of Pharo.
Trying to comment a class with a particular string provokes the opening of a debugger.

The task is about understanding and fixing this bug.

## Context: commenting a class

To comment a classe, one has to first open a system browser through the general menu: <br>
*Browse > System browser*.

Then, as illustrated in the following picture:
1. Select a class (for the purpose of this task, you can select any)
2. Click the *comment* pane in the text editor
3. Untick the *toggle edit* checkbox to be able to edit the text

From there, you can write your class comment and save it by doing a right click in the editor and click *Accept*, or by doing *CTRL + S* (*CMD* for Mac users).

## The problem

If you try to copy/paste this string into the comment text editor and then save it, the system crashes and opens a debugger on a primitive failure:

```
I'm a simple lexer. I'm used bt the DLitlleLParser.

I recogniseI
- names: list of characters letter and number and '
- separators: one character separator.
- escape char \

Whitespaces and separators can be customised using setters.
Subclasses may change the definition of names by redefining isCurrentALetter.
```
Example debugger opened after the primitive failure resulting from saving a class comment with the string defined above:

##Â Your task

For this task, you must:

* Understand the problem and explain it when you think you found it
* Fix the problem and commenting any class with the aforementionned string should not provoke any primitive failure!

To explain the problem, you will provide a few sentences describing what you understood.
